Illumina sequencers.

## Usage

1. Set up nextflow as [described
   here](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#GetStarted).
2. If you didn't run this pipeline in a while, possibly update nextflow itself.
    ```
    ./nextflow self-update
    ```
3. Then run the pipeline.
    ```
    ./nextflow run https://github.com/UnseenBio/shotgun-qc-nf
    ```
